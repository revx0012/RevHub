### How to use revhub

- For PC:

```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/RevHub/refs/heads/main/revhub.lua"))();
```

> You can hide the GUI by pressing Left Alt, though it can be changed by the **_Other Things_** Tab.


- For Mobile:

```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revx0012/RevHub/refs/heads/main/loader.lua"))();
```

> Helpful for mobile, you just load the script by pressing the button load. You can also minimize it (the loader) when needed
> 
> When done with the revhub, Close the GUI by the X. it should be easy to find
> 
> When you want the script again, load from the Loader. Then thats it!
